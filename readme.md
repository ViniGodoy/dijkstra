#Dijkstra Algorithm Demo
This is a simple sample of the Dijkstra algorithm implemented for Data Structures Discipline of PUCPR.

The goal of the program is to find the best path between two subway stations of the fictional city of Graphland. Take
a look in the extra folder for a picture of this subway system. A video explanation (in portuguese) is algo available on Youtube:
