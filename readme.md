# Dijkstra Algorithm Demo

This is a simple sample of the Dijkstra algorithm implemented for Data Structures Discipline of PUCPR.

The goal of the program is to find the best path between two subway stations of the fictional city of Graphland. Take
a look in the extra folder for [a picture](./extra/subwaySystem.pdf) of this subway system.

A video explanation (in portuguese) is also available on YouTube:
